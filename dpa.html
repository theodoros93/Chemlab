<center><h3>Design and implementation of a web application environment to assess the efficiency and manufacturability of chemical processes</center></h3></br>

In this diploma thesis, an online application was created and designed to optimize the collection of chemicals, for a chemical laboratory for proper processing, distribution, and pricing of these chemical materials. Another advantage of this application is the fact of using the collected chemicals and adding them to additional processes to produce a chemical material or use them for more chemical materials. 
Each laboratory needs, for its optimal functionality and efficiency, needs a well-structured application that assists in gathering data and recording it correctly (with all its data) so that results and conclusions can be smoothly achieved. This web application serves the above needs and enables the chemist to have all the data together, together with their data and pricing, to avoid any unnecessary expense during the processes.
In summary, the student created an online application in which the chemists of a laboratory will be able to process existing chemicals and produce new ones, through the process of collecting and calculating these elements. Also, they will be able to store these items as well as the processes that took place for their production.
Finally, for the design and creation of this web application, have been used numerous technologies for its front-end as well as its back-end functionality.</br></br></br>
